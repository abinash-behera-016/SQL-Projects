# Edvancer SQL Final Project

During the SQL module of our course, we were asked to do one final project, a set of 10 questions. We had to write queries and generate a csv for each query output. Further , there was also time limited quiz we had to clear the module. I have uploaded the quiz questions along with codes/answers in a separate file.
I have attached the necessary csv files and the questions along with my codes.

## Dataset Description
We were given a total of six csv data files to import into SSMS 20 and extract the necessary information as per the requirement of each question. Here is a brief overview of each given dataset.
- `Houses` : This contains the physical details of the houses the tenants are living in with columns 'house_type', 'bhk_type,bed_count', 'furnishing_type', 'beds_vacant', 'house_id'.
